How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

  My approach to designing software is to do the layout and steps to development before the final steps of implementation. My design skills have helped me design different objects with lighting in openGL.
  The design process that I followed was to use modular and reusable coding. Tacts could be applied in the future by using the same steps listed and ensuring I use them in the future. 
  
  I approach developing projects from a planning standpoint, where I can layout all the details needed. Iteration helped by making sure the project flowed smoothly and met all the requirements.'
  Developing code through milestones helps ensure the final projects has all of the features it needs. 
  
  Computer science can help me reach my goals by teaching me programming skills I will need for the future. The comp graphics and visualization skills will give me a good foundation shall I ever need them in the future.
